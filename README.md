# Free Speech Shield
Like the Newsguard web extension but for Free Speech

# Intro
This extension is meant to provide users with comprehensive at-a-glance data on the limits online communities put on speech. It's often pointed out that the first amendment only refers to state-enforced limitations on free speech. Corporations are allowed to do whatever they want with their platforms and there's nothing you can do about it except make your own. This is reasonable. After all, unlike "the public square" there is literally infinite server space for your shitposts. But what if we treated the entire internet like free speech actually mattered? You've heard of second amendment audits. We do that except we're a little more data-based because we use these data points:

* the country the server is beholden to
* the number of explicitly banned words or concepts (typically found in the "community guidelines" or equivalent)
* the number of user generated free speech violation reports
* whether moderators are aggressive
* whether moderators permaban users expressing legal speech
* whether moderators delete legal speech
* whether moderators shadowban
* whether you can post anonymously
* whether the rules regarding speech are vague
* ideological flavor of moderation

We also specify how frequently which category of information the moderators censor utilizing the following categories:

* basic porn
* advanced porn
* criminal information
* quasicriminal information
* political information
* scientific information

It's important to note that we do NOT make a distinction between which ideological flavor or the veracity of the censored information. All we care about is whether or not it is censored. The rationale is that a site shouldn't get an average score if they heavily censor only one type of political view. It's not really free speech if only a subset of speakers are free. 

For each category and subcategory, a score representing the likelihood a post containing that category of information is censored is assigned and these scores make the shape of the radar chart. Let's look at each of these categories in more detail.

# Censorship categories

## basic porn
Generally, the less taboo NSFW content such as solo, gangbang, gay, trans, bdsm, incest, hentai, vanilla, forced, or miscegenation porn. Very suggestive clothed pictures, such as what men fap to on facebook or instagram are also included here. Note that, despite the legislation in repressed nations like Canada and Australia, loli hentai and small tit porn is NOT counted as pedophilia for our purposes. It's not like those shitholes even have free speech anyway.

## advanced porn
This is the stuff that's even banned from most porn sites such as pedophilia, bestiality, scat, mutilation, necrophilia, or snuff. While plenty of people genuinely enjoy this stuff, it's found online for the purpose of grossing out other users far more often than basic porn. Most sites that allow basic porn do not allow advanced porn, so it's justified having this separate category.

## criminal
Many things are not protected by the first amendment to begin with, such as obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising. To clarify the distinction between "criminal" and "advanced porn" regarding pedophilia, shota erotica or loli hentai would be advanced porn whereas explicit pictures or videos of naked children. Remember, hate speech is incontrovertibly NOT illegal. 

## quasicriminal
This includes technically legal, albeit malicious, information like what is posted during doxxing, spamming, or targeted harassment.

## scientific
This is censorship of information regarding the nature of the natural universe. To reiterate, we do not make any judgement to the veracity of claim, so censorship of flat Earth theory, anti-vaccination, global warming theory, free energy technology, the existence of god, the existence of aliens, etc. This includes any scientific claim about a political issue such as transexual biology, whereas transexual *rights* would be considered "political". Auditing science journals or organizations is outside of our scope because we only care about how free speech is restricted in online communities.

## political
This is censorship of information about the political world. This includes any claim about the political process, opinions on hot-button political issues, rumors about politicians, facts about politicians, conspiracy theories, or leaked documents like the Panama Papers. Everything a politician says is not necessarily political. If an online community is censoring based on your political *identity*, we only count that as a violation if you first stated your political beliefs (which constitute your political identity). Being "fact-checked" on twitter would lower their score because they put an additional step between you and the information. Being fact-checked on youtube would NOT lower their score because they don't make you wait before consuming the fact-checked content.

It's important to note we are not concerned with discrimination, only censorship. Being banned from a female safespace because you are trans isn't something we care about, but being banned in a female safespace for *stating your belief* that the holocaust didn't happen would be counted as a free speech violation. A "niggers only" site would have a high free speech score if the users were allowed to discuss whatever they want, but not if they censored controversial racial statistics. Part of the rationale behind defocusing on discrimination is the fact that it's just so easy to lie. If you want to join a discord server that has the rule "manlets fuck off" and you're 4'2" all you have to do is never bring up your height. On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

# User submissions

Users can submit a report to increase the violation count a given online community has as well as suggest we audit a new site. The latter option puts a new url in the queue for us to audit which will take anywhere from 1 to 6 months. While users don't make accounts, you can type in your email before you suggest a site to be notified when the audit is complete. This system is also used to request new audits on sites already in our database.
