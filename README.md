# Free Speech Shield
Like the Newsguard web extension but for Free Speech

# Intro
This extension is meant to provide users with comprehensive at-a-glance data on the limits online communities put on speech. To do this we use the following data points:

* the country the server is beholden to
* the number of explicitly banned words or concepts (typically found in the "community guidelines" or equivalent)
* the number of user generated free speech violation reports
* whether moderators are aggressive
* whether moderators permaban users expressing legal speech
* whether moderators delete legal speech
* whether moderators shadowban
* whether you can post anonymously
* whether the rules regarding speech are vague
* idelogical flavor of moderation

We also specify how frequently which category of information the moderators censor utilizing the following categories:

* basic porn
* advanced porn
* criminal information
* political information
* heretical information
* scientific information
* sexist information
* racist information

It's important to note that we do NOT make a distinction between which ideological flavor or the veracity of the censored information. All we care about is whether or not it is censored. Let's look at each of these categories in more detail.

# Censorship categories

## basic porn
Generally, the less taboo NSFW content such as solo, gangbang, gay, trans, bdsm, incest, hentai, vanilla, forced, or miscegenation porn. Very suggestive clothed pictures, such as what men fap to on facebook or instagram are also included here. Note that, despite the legislation in repressed nations like Canada and Australia, loli hentai and small tit porn is NOT counted as pedophilia for our purposes. It's not like those shitholes even have free speech anyway.

## advanced porn
This is the stuff that's even banned from most porn sites such as pedophilia, bestiality, scat, mutilation, necrophilia, or snuff. While plenty of people genuinely enjoy this stuff, it's found online for the purpose of grossing out other users relatively more often than basic porn. 

## criminal
Many things are not protected by the first amendment to begin with, such as obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising. To clarify the distinction between "criminal" and "advanced porn" regarding pedophilia, erotica or merely suggestive pictures of kids would be advanced porn whereas explicit pictures or videos of naked children are considered criminal.

## political
This includes any claim about the political process, rumors about politicians, facts about politicians, conspiracy theories, or leaked documents such as the Panama Papers. However, everything a politician says is not necessarily political.

## heretical
Religious, anti-religious. Also includes aliens?

## scientific
To reiterate, we do not make any judgement to the veracity of claim, so censorship of flat Earth theory, anti-vaccination, global warming theory, free energy technology, etc.  This includes any scientific claim about a political issue such as transexual biology, whereas transexual *rights* would be considered "political".

## sexist
